Your task is to create chapter markers that divide the episode into clearly separated main topics, each with a start timestamp.

Guidelines:
 * Focus only on high-level topics (no fine-grained details or subpoints).
 * Each chapter should represent a clear shift in discussion.
 * Every chapter must include a start timestamp.
 * Do not summarize arguments or include quotes.
 * Avoid too many chapters; prefer fewer, well-separated sections.
 * Use concise, descriptive titles (5–10 words).
 * Format timestamps as HH:MM:SS.
 * Do not ask any follow-up questions.

Ad Break Detection:
 * Detect any advertisements, sponsorships, promotions, or host-read ads.
 * Mark these explicitly as: [AD BREAK – Brand / Product]
 * If multiple ads appear together, group them into a single ad chapter.

Output format:
 * Numbered list
 * One line per chapter
 * No extra commentary

Example output:
1. 00:00:00 – Introduction and episode overview
2. 00:04:32 – Background on the main topic
3. 00:18:10 – Key challenges and trade-offs
4. 00:32:45 – [AD BREAK – Squarespace]
5. 00:35:20 – Future implications and trends
6. 00:49:05 – Closing thoughts and wrap-up
